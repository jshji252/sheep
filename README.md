# The Sheep Exercise
This is the Sheep Exercise from Jongmin Kim's YouTube Channel, who is a (great) Interactive Developer at Google. [His YouTube Channel!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdeWxKJuvtUG2xyN6pOJEvA)

## Description
It's a fairly complicated canvas work, with everything moving (the hill, the sheep, even the Sun). And it draws the sheep's movement really well, looks very natural.

## My work
After following Jongmin's work, I found it very pleasing to watch the sheeps moving! until... I find out that they'climb the hills' at the same speed as they 'slide down' the hills. So I decided to fix that by using some simple linear functions that I developed. Now the sheeps' movements more closely mimic those of the real-world. Yay!

## How To Test
Clone the folder and open the sheep.html file. You might need to run it on a server to bypass the CORS restriction.
